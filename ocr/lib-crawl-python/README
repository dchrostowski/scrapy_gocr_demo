This project is going to use Python3.  Because there is no good reason not to.  We want to move forward, not stand still.

How to setup virtual environment using Ubuntu or Debian:

1. Get pip if you don't have it already:
`sudo apt-get install python-pip`  (or is it `pip-python?`)

2. `pip install virtualenv`

3. `cd project_folder`

4. `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 lib-crawl-python-env`

5. `source lib-crawl-python-env/bin/activate

6. If you see a requirements.txt and you just setup a new environment or if yours is out of date, run pip install -r requirements.ttxt

Install any and all pip packages you need while the virtual env is activated.  e.g.:

`pip install requests`

When done, deactivate the virtual environment by running:

`deactivate`

If any changes were made, export out to requirements.txt:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

DO NOT PUSH THE VIRTUALENV TO GIT. Add it to .gitignore.  Totally unnecessary and a complete waste of resources.  Simply push reuqirements.txt so that others can install modules and sync their modules with everyone else.
